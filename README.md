## JavaScript Dynamic Table (UFO sightings)

### UFO-level-1 Folder

Using a csv dataset of UFO sightings, I have writen code that that appends a table to my web page template and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* There is a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* I have used a date form in your HTML document and I have written JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### UFO-level-2 Folder

Using multiple `input` tags I have written JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
